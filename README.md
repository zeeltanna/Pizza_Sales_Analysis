# Pizza Sales Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data to understand patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve decision-making. It explores sales, revenue, and performance metrics via data cleaning, visualization, and SQL queries.

## 🗂️ Data & Files
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| pizza_sales.csv | Raw dataset of pizza sales. |
| Finding the total revenue from pizza sales.docx | Document with methodology / notes about revenue calculations. |
| Pizza Sales Dashboard.xlsx | Dashboard (Excel) summarizing key KPIs and visualizations. |
| SQLQuery2.sql, SQLQuery3.sql, SQLQuery4.sql | SQL scripts to query the dataset for specific insights (e.g., total revenue, sales by category, trends over time). |

## 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and prepare the raw sales data  
- Compute total revenue and breakdown by different segments (e.g., by pizza type, by region, by time-period)  
- Identify trends (seasonal, monthly, etc.) in pizza sales  
- Build dashboards / visualizations to present findings clearly  
- Provide actionable insights & recommendations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Data storage formats: CSV, Excel  
- SQL for querying the data  
- Excel for dashboarding & visualization  
- Possibly Python / other tools if expanded in future

## 🚀 How to Use / Run
1. Open or import the dataset (pizza_sales.csv) into your preferred environment (Excel, database, or data analysis tool).  
2. Run the SQL queries (.sql files) in a SQL client connected to a database that contains the data.  
3. Use Pizza Sales Dashboard.xlsx to view key metrics and visual summaries.  
4. Read through methodology in Finding the total revenue from pizza sales.docx to understand assumptions and calculation logic.

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
- Sales data accuracy depends on source; missing or incorrect records may impact findings.  
- Time-based trends may be skewed if data is incomplete for certain periods.  
- Dashboards in Excel may not auto-update with new data (unless refreshed or reloaded manually).

## 📈 Potential Extensions
- Incorporate more advanced visualizations using Python (e.g. matplotlib / seaborn) or tools like Tableau / Power BI  
- Automate data cleaning and reporting  
- Add forecasting models (e.g., time series forecasting) for future demand  
- Segment customers and analyze customer behaviour
